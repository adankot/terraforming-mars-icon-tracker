# Terraforming Mars icon tracker

Me and my friends love to play Terraforming Mars boardgame. After a couple of DLCs tracking icons just got
a bit of a pain. Like in Turmoil we have to count all of our science/building/V+J+E/green icons in almost every 
generation which could take some time. It also makes easier to track when you will be available for some milestones - 
without your opponents gets suspicious about you watching the milestones and counting your cards.

## Future steps
- Add some tests

## Ideas to discuss
- Tracking city tiles? - There is a lot of cards for counting city tiles (after 10 city it starts to take some time)
    >note: some cards only count cities on Mars / excluding Ganymede, Phobos and Stanford Torus
